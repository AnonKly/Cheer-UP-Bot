    "Take time to know yourself. Know thyself said Aristotle. When you know who you are, you can be wise about your goals, your dreams, your standards, your convictions. Knowing who you are allows you to live your life with purpose and meaning.",
    "A narrow focus brings big results. The number one reason people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go instead of how far they have come. But it's a series of small wins that can give us the most significant success.",
    "Show up fully. Don't dwell on the past, and don't daydream about the future, but concentrate on showing up fully in the present moment.",
    "Don't make assumptions. If you don't know the situation fully, you can't offer an informed opinion.",
    "Be patient and persistent. Life is not so much what you accomplish as what you overcome."

Out of all exams emotional and practical exams of life are the most valuable and toughest (which grown ups can better understand) To pass in the test of life you need atleast 13,700 good days. ( 50% criteria is tough actually) In simple words you must compensate each bad day with a day well lived Which means you can afford 13,700 bad days! And you are mourning over 1 written paper? Not worth it! Keep fighting for the 50% target! I know you can do this! \n")

We should pick ourselves up again, and face the problem head on, with the learnings of not repeating the same mistakes. That's the beauty of failing, we learn and we improve ourselves.

Being tired is a sign of strength, a warrior's cooldown even. You've been so strong and I'm 101% proud! Please allow yourself to rest, productivity can also mean prioritizing one's self.

We all want the best life for ourselves— a best country to be precise, it's just that sometimes, our beliefs can cloud our judgements. We will never know the complete intention and reason behind an action of a certain candidate or a soecific troll, but together as one, we can. This is not the time to foster anger deep within you, this should be the time we apply our well-known culture of 'bayanihan' and help each other create wiser choices this coming elections. So chill out, and bring others with you as you create a ripple of change or a small step towards a progressive country. Nananatiling matatag, palaging para sa Inang Bayan. \n")
